# HTML CSS Capstone project

This project has 2 pages, namely: home page, search page. The website is build using the modern css and html. I have extracted utility classes as much as possible for their reusability purposes.

The website is fully responsive with the help of three media query breakpoints (the default being the smaller viewport), namely: < 768px, >= 768px, >= 1024px, >= 1280px.
